                <!-- First paragraph -->
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp I currently attend UC Davis as a first year studying
                computer science. In the future, I hope to get a job as a software
                engineer.
                </p>
                <!-- Second paragraph -->
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp I know I am prepared for the challenges that lie
                ahead. From doing taekwondo, I learned to always persevere,
                because my ambitions are always reachable, no matter what I
                think. Being in a Mathcounts team has taught me to cooperate
                because not everything in life is independent. Sometimes, one
                must rely on his or her friends and colleagues in order to win a 
                contest or to get a raise. These experiences have taught me many
                things to be a better person, and they will definitely come in 
                handy when looking out to the future.
                </p>
                <!-- Concluding paragraph -->
                <p>&nbsp &nbsp Thank you for taking the time to read my page and  
                please take a look around the other pages.
